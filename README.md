# UBCExplorerIO
UBCExplorerIO is an app created using Swift. It uses APIs from [ubcexplorer.io](https://ubcexplorer.io) to display a list of courses offered at UBC, as well as any description, prerequisites, co-requisites, etc. It is designed to test my ability to build programs that interfaces with APIs
